    Network Security Configuration for ComfyChair

    This app requires cleartext (HTTP) traffic to be permitted because:
    1. ComfyUI servers are typically self-hosted on local networks
    2. Local servers often don't have SSL/TLS certificates configured
    3. Users connect to arbitrary IP addresses on their private networks

    The app supports and prefers HTTPS when available (auto-detection in ComfyUIClient).
    Self-signed certificates are also supported with user notification.

    See: https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config

        Base configuration: Allow cleartext traffic for local ComfyUI server connections.
        The app performs automatic HTTP/HTTPS detection and prefers HTTPS when available.
